        <h2> Specialisation: Head Hunting and Recruitment <h2>

        <p> Branson Brown is a boutique recruitment company which specializes in senior management roles, the increasing drive for talented state managers, senior engineering and technical roles in design, construction, project management, delivery and commissioning.
        WE specialise in difficult to find searches. This may be because of technical needs of the role, candidate shortage or corporate confidentiality.

        Our methods are determined by the client brief and tailored to the assignment. This is the most essential part of our process, as we often find the ability to deliver to the clients need is determined by the quality of this initial communication. This initial approach is not set in stone and our ongoing review during the assignment may see this changed or modified. In this increasingly difficult candidate environment we will adopt new and innovative ethical methods to find your candidate. We follow procedures and quality assurance to accepted industry best practice.

        We do not take on all assignments. We endeavor to have no conflict of interest between clients. To find out if we can be of assistance or refer you to someone who can assist in your special requirements, without obligation.

        Please phone Peter Brown on 0418 74 69 64 or email peter@bransonbrownassociates.com.au </p>
